```Abstract: This article will state the importance of unit testing Angular services. Then will explain the process of unit testing services and HTTP calls in an Angular application```

Angular services contain the UI-independent reusable business logic of the application. This logic could be used at multiple places in the application to get or calculate the data to be shown on the page. So, it is very important to make sure that the logic in the services is correct. Otherwise this could result in issues at multiple places in the application. Unit tests can be used to test the services by invoking the functionality directly.

As discussed in the last article, unit testing can be used to invoke and test the behavior of a piece of code in isolation. The reusable logic written in services requires this kind of testing, as unit testing provides ways to test all possible scenarios by sending different types of data to the service methods.

Also, most applications use services to communicate with the backend APIs. It is important to make sure that the calls to these services are made correctly and their responses are correctly handled in the application. Unit tests help in checking for the correctness in these calls. Angular framework includes a testing module to test the API calls by providing mock responses. This setup can be used to effectively test whether the right set of APIs are called with correct parameters and then on how the success and failures of the APIs are handled.

This article will provide you with enough knowledge on setting up a test file to unit test a service. And then it will show how the calls to backend APIs can be unit tested.
